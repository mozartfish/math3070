*Remember: I expect to see commentary either in the text, in the code with comments created using `#`, or (preferably) both! **Failing to do so may result in lost points!***

## Problem 1 (Verzani problem 5.1)
*For the `UScereal` (**MASS**) data set, create a scatter plot of `calories` modeled by `sugars` using the `shelf` variable to create different plot characters. Add a legend to indicate the shelf number. Is there any patterns? (Use base R plotting for this problem.)*

```{r, tidy=TRUE, error=TRUE}
# Your code here
```

## Problem 2 (Verzani problem 5.3)
*For the data set `UScereal` (**MASS**) make a pairs plot of the numeric variables. Which correlation looks larger: fat and calories or fat and sugars?*

```{r, tidy=TRUE, error=TRUE}
# Your code here
```

## Problem 3 (Verzani problem 5.4)
*For the data set `batting` (**UsingR**) make a bubble plot of home runs hit (`HR`) modeled by hits (`H`) where the scale factor for each point is given by `sqrt(SO)/10`. Is there any story to be told by the size of the points? (You must use base R plotting for this problem.)*

```{r, tidy=TRUE, error=TRUE}
# Your code here
```
